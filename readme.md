# WIP saga pattern demo

This project aim to show an orchestrated saga using dotnet and dapr.

## How to run

There is few projects to run with dapr in order to get the full app to work. Each projects have a _run.sh_ file to execute in order to run the app locally as expected. Projects are

* Saga.Card
* Saga.Orchestrator

Feel free to turn off and on again each project during a saga
